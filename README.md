# *MLP Construction*

*Construct a Neural Network from scratch with Logistic Regression Units*

**Key Features**
- Logistic regression finds the optimal W,b such that y = WTX + b
- It is a classification task which takes the sign of the output
- This is an activation function
- Each of these units can form a neuron in the neural network
- Implemented from scratch with only NumPy
- Compute forward pass and backwards pass
